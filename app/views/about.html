    <p>CoveredU.org is an educational tool designed by the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative (CCHI) to help you understand the basics of how health insurance works. We want to make sure people can better understand and use their health insurance so they can get the most for their money and be healthier. CoveredU is for people who don’t understand or have little experience with health insurance. It can also be a tool to refresh your memory about terms or concepts you may have forgotten. The cost estimates used in this tool are based on real health insurance plans, but may be more or less than your actual costs because plan benefits and prices vary based on things like your age and where you live.
    </p><p>
    CCHI is a membership based non-partisan, non-profit policy advocacy organization working toward equitable access to quality, affordable health care for all Coloradans. CoveredU is a part of our public education efforts to help consumers get the health care they need, when they need it.
